        A Desktop Agent is a desktop component (or aggregate of components) that
        serves as a

        launcher and message router (broker) for applications in its domain.


        A Desktop Agent can be connected to one or more App Directories and will
        use directories for application

        identity and discovery. Typically, a Desktop Agent will contain the
        proprietary logic of

        a given platform, handling functionality like explicit application
        interop workflows where

        security, consistency, and implementation requirements are proprietary.
