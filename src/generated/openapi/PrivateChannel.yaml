      description: >-
        Object representing a private context channel, which is intended to
        support

        secure communication between applications, and extends the Channel
        interface

        with event handlers which provide information on the connection state of
        both

        parties, ensuring that desktop agents do not need to queue or retain
        messages

        that are broadcast before a context listener is added and that
        applications

        are able to stop broadcasting messages when the other party has
        disconnected.


        It is intended that Desktop Agent implementations:

        - SHOULD restrict external apps from listening or publishing on this
        channel.

        - MUST prevent private channels from being retrieved via
        fdc3.getOrCreateChannel.

        - MUST provide the `id` value for the channel as required by the Channel
        interface.
