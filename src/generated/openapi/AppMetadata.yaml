            The 'friendly' app name. 

            This field was used with the `open` and `raiseIntent` calls in FDC3
            <2.0, which now require an `AppIdentifier` wth `appId` set. 

            Note that for display purposes the `title` field should be used, if
            set, in preference to this field.

            receive a specified type (e.g. "channel<fdc3.instrument>").

      title: AppMetadata
      description: >-
        Extends an `AppIdentifier`, describing an application or instance of an
        application, with additional descriptive metadata that is usually
        provided by an FDC3 App Directory that the desktop agent connects to.


        The additional information from an app directory can aid in rendering UI
        elements, such as a launcher menu or resolver UI. This includes a title,
        description, tooltip and icon and screenshot URLs.


        Note that as `AppMetadata` instances are also `AppIdentifiers` they may
        be passed to the `app` argument of `fdc3.open`, `fdc3.raiseIntent` etc.
      type: object
